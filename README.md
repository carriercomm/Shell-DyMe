Shell-DyMe
A Dynamic Menu for all your functions.

Just run: menu... It will read all folders in that folder. 
It will read the file  "*.name" and give that folder its name.
	NOTE: No spaces allowed! It will break if you do use a space.
	
The text in the "*.name" file will describe the menu and shows it when you enter that menu.
